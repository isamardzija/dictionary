## How It's Made

Created using HTML5, CSS and Vanilla JS. The application uses the API from https://dictionaryapi.dev/ to get all the definitions and rest of the data.

## Lessons Learned

- **Dark Mode** - This is my first project that has an actual dark mode switch. Had lots of fun figuring it out.
- **Font Switcher** - Another first for me. Fairly simple to implement, but a cool feature nonetheless. Had a bit of trouble making it work for both mobile and desktop devices.
